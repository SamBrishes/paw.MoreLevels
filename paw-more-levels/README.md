paw.MoreLevels - A Bludit Plugin to extend the Depth
====================================================
The paw.MoreLevels Bludit Plugin modifies the core `Pages` class (using an own class, which inherits
the core one) as well as the default `booty` administration theme (using JavaScript) to allow to
add more then 2 levels of pages. It also overwrites the AJAX call to `ajax/get-parents` to
achieve a seamless integrations, which also fixes a known [issue](https://github.com/bludit/bludit/issues/777)!

Only tested with the current [Bludit](https://bludit.org/) version (3.5.0)!

Installation
------------
1.  Just upload the main directory `paw-more-levels` to your `bl-plugins` folder.
2.  Activate the `paw.MoreLevels` plugin on the administration backend
3.  Create your Content, with more Levels, using the known ways!
