paw.MoreLevels - A Bludit Plugin to extend the Depth
====================================================
This Bludit plugin overwrites the core `Pages` class to allow more then 2 levels of pages. It also adds some JavaScript "Stuff" and takes over a core AJAX call to list all available pages under "Parent" when adding new or editing existing pages (works only on the default admin theme "booty" of course!).

Only tested with the current [Bludit](https://bludit.org/) version (3.5.0)!
